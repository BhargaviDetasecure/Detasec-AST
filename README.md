# Description
Solana blockchain has a limited number of learning resources. Due to a lack of resources, we came up with the idea of __"learning solana security in an interactive way."__ DAST is an interactive platform where you will first learn about a vulnerability, then solve an exercise containing vulnerable code, and you must write the correct code to win.
